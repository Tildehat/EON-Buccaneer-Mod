# EON Buccaneer Mod
 Mod of Etrian Odyssey Nexus to add the Buccaneer class to the game

This only works on the North American version of EON

Notes:
	Vampire portraits are added along with the Buccaneer class. No need to unlock Vampires to get access to the portraits.
	
	When selecting Change Look the Vampire preview will show instead of the Buccaneer preview. Portraits are the same as making the class though.
	
	When subclassing Buccaneer the name will be blank on the status screen
	
	The "B" from Buccaneer is not shown on the equipment class list.
	
	Ordering of skills gets weird sometimes. I'm not sure how to fix this.
	
	
v1.0

-Fixed Force Breaks from doing chip damage

-Fixed Chasers to properly inherit elements. Eg Fire-slash chaser will now follow up with a Fire+Cut+Weapon Element instead of just Weapon Element. This also makes Vulcan stance increase chaser damage.

-Adjusted the stat growth for Buccaneers. Before their early level stats grew much faster than other classes.


v1.1

-Fixed a bug involving Dirty Fighting procing on normal attacks.

-Buccaneer's Rapier skills now use the AGL stat for damage.

-Buccaneer's Gun skills now target the enemy's AGL stat.(Formula is VIT+AGL)

-Hanging lowers their AGL defense(Gun skills will do more damage) for 1 turn

-Quick Draw increases the user's AGL for 1 turn(Rapier Skills will do more damage)

-Pincushion now uses the user's AGL for offense and the enemy's AGL for their defensive stat.

-Fixed a bug where Bullet Storm wouldn't be able to petrify the enemy.

-Fixed the display text of Dirty fighting proc.


v1.2

-Fixed a bug where Quick Draw buff was raising the damage of all damage sources instead of just rapier skills/Pincushion.

-Bullet Storm actually petrifies instead of paralyzing the enemy.

-Fixed a bug where Dirty fighting would have a guaranteed proc rate if equipping a gun but no rapier.

-Fixed a bug where using Buccaneer Force Boost could cause a crash while playing on a 3DS.
